# pdftoimage.rb
A short simple script to covert a pdf to images using ruby gem rmagick 

# Why
This simple script can be used to convert pdf files to images. This task can easily be used for web appliction with rails implementation. In fact, I will probably expand on this script a little more in the near future and include rails implementation for dynamic pdf conversions.
